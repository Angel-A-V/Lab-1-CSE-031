TPS 2:

    Question 1:
    You can open the terminal using the combination of windows key + x and it gives you a display saying terminal, or you can always use the power shell app with admin privileges
    You can also use the combination of windows key + r and then type cmd and it will open command directory

        Part A:
            Yes you can open multiple terminals at once

        Part B: 
            I believe this would be necessary for debugging, and real time viewing and organization and certain projects may require multiple terminals for working together

    Question 2:
        Ls list the files in the current directory
    
    Question 3:
        On windows you have to do this " cd C:\Users\<user-name>\Desktop " 
    
    Question 4:
        To make a new directory we have to use the command "mkdir <name>" and the name isn't in these < it's just an example.

    Question 5:
        what -c flag does in gcc, complies source file into object files but not link them up
    
    Question 5:
        The -g flag in gcc tells the commpiler to include the debugging inforamtion in the program being compiled
    
    Question 6:
        To change the name of the executable file, you type "mv filename cselab1" which in our case changes filename to our new name cselab1
    
    Question 7:
        What it does is compile an executable file with a default name as "a.out" in which we have to run seprately with a different command
    
    Question 8:
        The command to run the code we just compiles is "./a", it's different with different file names but the default executable is a
